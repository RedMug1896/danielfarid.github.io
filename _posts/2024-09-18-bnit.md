 <p>This week I has lucky enough to attend the National Center of Computer Forensics in Hoover, AL for a second time. This week long course centered on basic network investigative techniques and network incident mitigation methods.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading"> Take Aways </h2>

<p> Just wrapped up the Basic Network Investigation Training (BNIT), and it was an enlightening week full of practical insights and hands-on learning. This course, designed for investigators and supervisors, dives deep into network investigation techniques and incident mitigation.</p>

<p> One of the highlights was learning how to effectively respond to hacking incidents. The course offered practical exercises on using essential tools that are pivotal in these scenarios. We delved into the command line for efficient navigation and management of network systems. Wireshark proved invaluable for analyzing network traffic, helping us pinpoint unusual activity and potential breaches. We also explored Autopsy for digital forensics, allowing us to piece together evidence from network artifacts. FTK Imager was another key tool we used, providing comprehensive imaging of drives to ensure data integrity during investigations.</p>

<p> The blend of instructor-led discussions and hands-on practical exercises made complex topics like network topologies, connectivity, and incident management approachable. I am very happy that I started my preparations to take the Network+ Exam prior to attending this class. The training was delivered in a very easy to understand method but a basic understanding communication protocols is assumed. The group exercise at the end brought everything together, demonstrating how to apply our new knowledge in real-world scenarios. Overall, BNIT was a fantastic course for anyone looking to build a solid foundation in network investigations and response strategies.</p>
