<p>I am professionally in the digital forensics field, teaching myself different technology topics. This website is meant to document my projects and learn new skills along the way.</p>

<p>I received a Bachelor of the Arts Degree in Sociology and a Master of the Arts Degree in Criminal Justice, both from Rowan University. In addition to my academic background, I am committed to ongoing professional development and currently maintain several key certifications. These include being a Magnet Certified GrayKey Examiner, Certified Cellebrite Operator, Certified Cellebrite Physical Analyst, Magnet Certified Forensic Examiner and a licensed FAA Part 107 Small Unmanned Aircraft Drone Pilot.</p>
